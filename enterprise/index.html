          <p>"Convox has helped us get back control over our development process while reducing our ops costs and workload. The team was also super proactive in assisting us with our more complex intranet hosting platform, helping us meet very strict security and compliance requirements."</p>

          <p>"Convox's architecture continues to amaze us, and it keeps getting better. We've been able to automate and reduce our scope on countless PCI compliance requirements. No tool or architecture we've used has helped with PCI compliance hurdles nearly as much as Convox."</p>

          <p>Convox is incredibly easy use and maintain and it plugs into our existing AWS setup. Now that our team has a private and secure PaaS, managing all our internal business apps is a breeze.</p>
