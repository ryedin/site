title: The New Convox Development Platform

As part of the ongoing [Convox 2.0 effort](https://docs.convox.com/), today I'm excited to offer a preview of the brand new Convox development platform.

These new tools turn your development computer into a platform that you interact with exactly like you do a cloud Platform-as-a-Service. This offers true development and production parity, and makes working on microservices easier than ever.

```console
$ cx apps create
creating docs: OK

$ cx start
build   | building: docs
build   | Step 1/4 : FROM golang:1.8.3
build   | Step 2/4 : RUN go get -v github.com/gohugoio/hugo
build   | Step 3/4 : WORKDIR /app
build   | Step 4/4 : COPY . .
build   | running: docker tag 9836064b convox/docs/web:BFGEZTOEXR
build   | build complete
convox  | promoting RIJBGELKDA
convox  | starting: convox.docs.service.web.1
convox  | starting: convox.docs.service.web.2
web     | syncing: . to /app
web     | Listening on port 1313

$ cx services
NAME  ENDPOINT
web   https://web.docs.convox
```

Here we created, build and deployed an app to our local machine. It is syncing code changes into the web containers and load balancing traffic between them. We can access it at a friendly URL:

## Development Platform

The [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net) methods talk about keeping development and production as similar as possible, aka [Dev / Prod parity](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity).

The new development platform finally achieves this goal.

It offers commands like `cx apps create`, `cx deploy`, `cx env`, `cx run` and  to manage apps, environment and processes on your local computer.

More importantly it emulates everything about the production environment like load balancing to multiple containers, SSL termination, DNS and more.

When you develop apps in this fashion, you need little to no code changes or tooling changes when going to production.

The result is shipping code faster and safer.

## Microservices

We work with lots of development teams and an an extremely common challenge arises around microservices. When you have 5 small apps that interact with each other, managing everything on a laptop can be very challenging.

The development platform design addresses this head on. You can now "deploy" all of these apps to run in the background of you computer with `cx deploy`, then bring one or more to the "foreground" to work on with `cx start`.

```
$ cx apps create api
creating api: OK

$ cx deploy
build complete
convox  | starting: convox.api.resource.database
convox  | starting: convox.api.service.web.1
convox  | starting: convox.api.service.web.2
convox  | starting: convox.api.service.worker.1

$ cx apps create dashboard
creating dashboard: OK

$ cx start
build complete
starting: convox.dashboard.service.web.1
starting: convox.api.service.web.2
web     | syncing: . to /app
```

Here we are running the "api" app and its database in the background, and the "dashboard" app in the foreground. The dashboard code can access the API through the static `https://web.api.convox` URL.

## Try it out

If you'd like to give it a try, check out the [local development tutorial](https://docs-staging.convox.com/walkthroughs/local/) for more details.

Stay tuned for more announcements around Convox 2.0!
