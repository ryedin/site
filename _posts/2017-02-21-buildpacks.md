title: Deploying with Buildpacks

Convox now officially supports [Heroku buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks).

Buildpacks are build scripts maintained over the years by language specialists at Heroku and in the open source community. Buildpacks introspect an application code base, detect what language it is, then run scripts that build an application package with the right language runtime, dependencies and more.

Under the hood, Convox still leverages Docker and a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) to build images for an app containers. But for apps that don't have a Dockerfile, Convox now generates one that uses a buildpack. This bypasses all of the work needed to write a good Dockerfile, like picking a base OS, installing the right version of a langage VM, and installing dependencies correctly.

The result is that you can jump straight into deploying an app -- no complex "Dockerizing" step necessary.

Let's give it a try...

## Ghost App

First, clone an app. We'll use with the Ghost blogging platform. This app follows the [twelve-factor methods](https://12factor.net/), so it should be easy to build and deploy with a buildpack.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cobyism/ghost-on-heroku.git ghost-on-convox
$ cd ghost-on-convox
```

## Convox Init

Next, we'll use the `convox init` utility. This generates Docker configuration files that use a Heroku buildpack.

```
$ convox init
Updating convox/init... OK
Initializing a nodejs app
Writing entrypoint.sh... OK
Writing Dockerfile... OK
Writing .dockerignore... OK
Writing docker-compose.yml... OK

Try running `convox start`
```

## Convox Deploy

Now we're ready to deploy it:

```
$ convox deploy

We see that the build service uses the buildpack to package our application into a Docker image.

## Convox Env

Before the app will run, it needs a bit more configuration. The app environment variables are enumerated in the `docker-compose.yml` that was generated:


```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  web:
    command: npm start --production
    environment:
    - PORT=4001
    - HEROKU_URL=https://YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com
    - S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    - S3_ACCESS_SECRET_KEY=
    - S3_BUCKET_NAME=
    - S3_BUCKET_REGION=
    - S3_ASSET_HOST_URL=
    - PGSSLMODE=
```

The app needs to know its base URL. Let's use its ELB hostname for now.

```
$ convox apps info
Name       ghost-on-convox
Status     running
Release    RZWVBDWUPDB
Processes  database web
Endpoints  internal-ghost-on-convox-databa-DAL5SGR-i-1450741732.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:5432 (database)
           ghost-on-convox-web-FF7DD5F-224923604.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:443 (web)
           ghost-on-convox-web-FF7DD5F-224923604.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:80 (web)


$ convox env set HEROKU_URL=ghost-on-convox-web-FF7DD5F-224923604.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
Updating environment... OK
To deploy these changes run `convox releases promote RFWIVAEBSPI`

$ convox releases promote RFWIVAEBSPI
Promoting RFWIVAEBSPI... UPDATING
```

## Convox Resources

Finally we can add a production Postgres database. We'll create one and give the app a new DATABASE_URL.

```
$ convox resources create postgres
Creating postgres-4328...

$ convox resources info postgres-4328
Name    postgres-4328
Status  running
Exports
  URL: postgres://postgres:***@dev-postgres-4328.cyzckls48pd3.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/app

$ convox env set DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:***@dev-postgres-4328.cyzckls48pd3.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/app
Updating environment... OK
To deploy these changes run `convox releases promote RWTRTXMWUSZ`

$ convox releases promote RWTRTXMWUSZ
Promoting RWTRTXMWUSZ... UPDATING
```

## Conclusion

By using buildpacks we can get a production-ready app running in a few minutes in our private AWS account. All the details of getting buildpacks, Docker and AWS working together are taken care of.

This lets us focus entirely on making app changes and deploying them.
