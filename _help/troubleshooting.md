## I got an error while installing Convox

Look at the AWS [Cloudformation Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1) and look for CREATE_FAILED errors on the "Events" tab.

Open a [Github issue](https://github.com/convox/rack/issues/new) with any errors you see in these events.

## I get an error when I deploy my app to Convox

Run `convox logs --app convox` to inspect the Convox API logs for errors and `convox deploy` to try again.

## My app deployed but I cannot access it

Run `convox apps info` to find the load balancer endpoints for your application.

Run `convox ps` to determine if your application is booting successfully.

Run `convox logs` to inspect your application logs and cluster events for problems placing your container, starting your app, or registering with the load balancer.


## ECS

If you're encountering problems like any of the following:

- deployments seem stuck in `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS` CloudFormation state
- your Rack seems stuck in `converging`
- your deploys seem stuck with services continuously being killed via SIGKILL and restarted

... then you should check the [ECS section of your AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home). To do so, log into the AWS ECS web UI and click the Cluster for your Rack. You'll be taken to a screen with a list of **Services**. Click on the name of the service (see note below for naming conventions). You'll be taken to a screen with an **Events** tab. The events there should provide some clues about why the service isn't stabilizing.

<div class="block-callout block-show-callout type-info" markdown="1">
**Service names**: ECS service names are in the format `<rack name>`-`<app name>`-`Service<ServiceName>`-`<random string>`. For example, for a service defined as `worker` in your `docker-compose.yml`, an app named `store` on a Rack named `prod`, the name will be `prod-store-ServiceWorker-ABC123RANDOM123XYZ`.

Another note: every Rack cluster has two internal ECS services named in the format `<rack name>`-WebService-`<random string>` and `<rack name>`-MonitorService-`<random string>`. These are for the internal Rack API and agent, respectively, and you shouldn't normally need to worry about them.
</div>

If the listed reason is `Instance has failed at least the UnhealthyThreshold number of health checks consecutively`, this means your app is failing its [health checks](/docs/rolling-updates/#health-checks). Often this is because your app is not actually listening on the port(s) specified for the service in your `docker-compose.yml`. Or your Rack might be missing an environment variable defined in your `docker-compose.yml`. It might also be an error from your application itself (check the [app logs with `convox logs`](/docs/debugging/#convox-logs), or use [`convox instances ssh`](/docs/debugging/#convox-instances-ssh) to check docker logs).

Once you've found the reason, you can run [`convox apps cancel -a app_name`](/docs/deploying-to-convox/#canceling-a-deployment) to cancel this deployment. Once it rolls back, you can fix the error and try to deploy again.
